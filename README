=============
  Purpose
=============

This is my attempt to create another imageboard based on the famouse
Danbooru.  This is my backup in case something goes wrong.  If you want
too follow along, you're welcome to.

I'm going to post my progress as I go along until I arrive to my goal
and make a significantly different application.

Until then, it would be wise to follow Danbooru v2.0 http://github.com/r888888888/danbooru

  Updates
=============

- Users can create multiple avatars
- Set default avatar and pick between them
- Avatars have keywords or labels
- Helper methods for avatars
