=============
  Purpose
=============

This is my attempt to create another imageboard based on the famouse
Danbooru.  This is my backup in case something goes wrong.  If you want
to follow along, you're welcome to.

I'm going to post my progress until I arrive to my goal
and make a significantly different application.

Until then, it would be wise to follow Danbooru v2.0 http://github.com/r888888888/danbooru
